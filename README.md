# Mallcustomer-Kmeansclustering
This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. By applying the Elbow Method and clustering customers into meaningful groups, the project helps identify patterns such as high spenders, low spenders, and average customers.
